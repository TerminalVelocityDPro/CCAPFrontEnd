## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for Clovis COVID-19 Awareness Program, otherwise known as CCAP. <br />
This web app was created by students at **Clovis North High School**, under the Project Manager, **Deepro Pasha**, and Adult Supervisor, **Mary Allen**.
<br />
CCAP's purpose is to recommend resources tailored to the specific needs of students in the Clovis Unified School District, and connect the students to available services, such as seeing the School Psychologist.
<br />

## User Interface
>   We don't need another Google Form - Deepro Pasha
<br /> 
There was desire for the user interface of CCAP to distinct itself from the mundane and gloomy style of a "Google Form". 
<br />
Taking inspiration from mobile apps like K Health, CCAP was developed with the thought of creating an engaging and interactive survey via a social messaging style survey. <br />

*Below is a picture of the style of which the CCAP survey would be based on*
