# CCAPFrontEnd
Welcome to the repository for Clovis COVID-19 Awareness Program, otherwise known as CCAP. 
This web app was created by students at Clovis North High School, under the Project Manager, Deepro Pasha, and Adult Supervisor, Mary Allen.
Its intended purpose is to serve a resource distrivutor for students in the Clovis Unified School District, and recommend resources tailored to the specific needs of students.
The web app was designed to have a user inteference similar to that of a modern messaging platform, producing enganging and interactive participation from the user.
