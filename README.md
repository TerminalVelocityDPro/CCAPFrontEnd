# CCAPFrontEnd
Welcome to the repository for Clovis COVID-19 Awareness Program, otherwise known as CCAP. <br />
This web app was created by students at **Clovis North High School**, under the Project Manager, **Deepro Pasha**, and Adult Supervisor, **Mary Allen**.<br />
Its intended purpose is to serve a resource distributor for students in the Clovis Unified School District, and recommend resources tailored to the specific needs of students.<br />
The web app was designed to have a user inteference similar to that of a modern messaging platform, producing enganging and interactive participation from the user.<br />

## The Beginnings
CCAP was started by Deepro Pasha inn August 3rd, 2020 in the midst of the COVID-19 Pandemic. There was need for students to receive help and resources, CCAP was designed with the specific intention for students to communicate their struggles in a user interface that took a more modern interactive approach as compared to a traditional Google Form.
